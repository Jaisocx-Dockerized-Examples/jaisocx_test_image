rc-service networking stop 
rc-service sshd start 
rc-service chronyd status 


For example, for a service named "base", the configuration file would be /etc/conf.d/base.

rc-status

A runlevel is simply a directory in /etc/runlevels,
 and an enabled service is a symlink to the init.d file. 
 For example, adding the sshd service to the default runlevel 
 is creating a symlink to /etc/init.d/sshd in /etc/runlevels/default. 
 Creating a new runlevel thus involves creating a new directory under /etc/runlevels.


Most of the time, you do not want to shut down all of your default services 
if you’re switching to the office runlevel. Runlevel "inheritance" is acheived through runlevel stacking. 
If you pass the -s flag to rc-update, you can actually add a runlevel to a runlevel. 
For example, if you wanted to have an office runlevel that would be the same as default, 
but with the myvpn service started, you would do the following to set that up:

mkdir /etc/runlevels/office
rc-update -s add default office
rc-update add myvpn office
